# My First App with Vue.js and Node

This is my first attempt at a Vue.js App

**Prerequisites:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

* [Getting Started](#getting-started)
> [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/) I decide to use Okta which has Authentication and User Management APIs that reduce development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure. Okta's intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage, and secure users and roles in any application.
